"""
Integration tests for the Text User Interface (TUI) screens.

This test suite should detect General Issues with any of the UI screen.
They mostly serve as smoke tests to catch errors during screen composition.

They _actually_ use the Textual testing framework, unlike the rest of the
stupid tests in this project.

Tests are marked with @pytest.mark.asyncio to enable async test execution,
which is done explicitly because I want to contain asyncio to its own
awful little corner of hell instead of spreading it everywhere.
