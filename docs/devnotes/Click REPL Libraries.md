[[Typer Library|Typer]] does not seem to have the REPL feature, but I found some useful experience reports in the github issue:

https://github.com/fastapi/typer/issues/185

There seems to be click-repl:

https://github.com/click-contrib/click-repl

And there is also click-shell:

https://github.com/clarkperkins/click-shell
https://click-shell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

It doesn't too complex. Since it has been more or less unmaintained in 5 years, I may or may not just write my own based on it.
