I genuinely love Click, it is:
* Easy to use
* Composable
* Can have lazy loaded subcommands for plug-ins/modules
* Uses decorators instead of some stuffy object factory
* Has multiplatform wrappers for Basic Terminal Things like colors and progress bars built in
* Has nice extensions like [click-prompt](https://github.com/markusgrotz/click-prompt) for the pizzaz of drop down selection menus

I would use it outright except it does not seem to offer an interactive mode, unlike [[Cliff Library]], which does.

As a bonus: It absolutely can be integrated with [[Rich]] for terminal output, which is banging.

Apparently: there's a handful or [[Click REPL Libraries]] available from extras or community, which could actually make this very usable.
