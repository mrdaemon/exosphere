Exosphere configuration
=======================

The configuration module in Exosphere is wildly flexible, allowing you
to essentially provide your configuration structure in any format you'd like.

Out of the box, there is support for the following configuration formats:
- yaml
- json
- toml
- Raw Python mapping (dict-like)

It is *deeply* inspired from the Flask configuration system, since good
things are good.
