Reporting Interfaces
====================

The `exosphere.reporting` module provides interfaces for generating reports in
various formats, including HTML, Markdown, and plain text. It leverages the
Jinja2 templating engine.

It is also responsible for returning the JSON representation of `Host` objects.
