Quickstart Guide
================

After :doc:`Installing Exosphere<installation>`, you can quickly get started by
following this guide and adapting the simple scenario it presents to your needs.

Scenario
--------

Let's assume you have a handful of hosts on your network, and you wish to use Exosphere
to keep track of their updates and basic online status, and get reporting on them.

For this example, we will assume you have the following hosts:

- `db1.example.com`: A Debian-based database server
- `web1.example.com`: A RedHat-based web server
- `files.example.com``: A FreeBSD-based file server

Your username on all of those hosts is `admin`, and you have SSH access to them.
